    excerpt: "AI-Driven Multi-Agent Market Analysis Platform",
    description: `QuantLLM is a multi-agent trading intelligence system that transforms real-time OHLCV data into explainable insights rather than predictions. Built for transparency, it uses agents that interpret RSI, MACD, and ROC indicators, candlestick patterns, trend signals, and custom risk controls.

The system summarizes market conditions with natural-language analysis powered by Gemini AI, helping users understand momentum and volatility without black-box forecasting.

Core features include a multi-agent design for Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk analysis, a real-time OHLCV dashboard with visual signals and CSV export, AI-generated plain-language explanations of technical signals, and synthetic data fallback for offline resilience.

Outcome: Provides transparent, educational analytics for crypto, stocks, and forex tradersâ€”bridging quantitative metrics with AI explainability.`,
